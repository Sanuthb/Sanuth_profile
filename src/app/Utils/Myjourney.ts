    title: "My Journey in Technology: A Path of Growth and Resilience",
    description:
      "It all started in 8th grade. Until then, I hadn’t really figured out what I wanted to do in life—other than eat, sleep, and maybe pass exams. Then, a teacher told me I had potential in computers, and something clicked. I decided computer science was my path! At first, I thought programming would be easy… boy, was I wrong. I actually failed my computer science subject and questioned all my life choices. But a few weeks before my 10th-grade boards, I decided it was do-or-die time. I studied programming line by line, and suddenly things started to make sense. I went from barely scraping by to writing my own code.",
    description2:
      "And that same teacher who first encouraged me later asked why I even took computer science in the first place! But I proved to her (and myself) that I could handle it. This was the beginning of learning that setbacks can be set-ups for comebacks.",
    description3:
      "In school, I was also really into building science models. My friends and I built a hydraulic arm, a hydraulic tree transplantation machine, an ocean-cleaning hoverboat, and even attempted a solenoid car engine (which, well… almost worked). I was also on my school’s football team and competed at the state level in KISA football. But yeah, there were times I got demotivated, especially when things didn’t go as planned.",

    title: "High School: Strengthening My Passion for CS",
    description:
      "In 11th and 12th grades, computer science was my main focus. I wasn’t that interested in other subjects (sorry, mom and dad). During this time, I got a chance to attend a workshop and compete alongside engineering students—a great learning experience and an ego check, honestly! Then, during 11th grade, I went through a life-changing challenge. I wasn’t sure what the outcome would be, but by God’s grace, I made it through, and my career direction was shaped more than ever.",

    title: "College Days: BCA, New Skills & A Few Surprises",
    description:
      "After 12th, I decided to take BCA instead of engineering. I just didn’t want to deal with CET or JEE. I told myself, “I’ll make this work.” I spent three months learning web development before starting college, getting a head start on my career.",
    description2:
      "When college finally began, I jumped into as many programming languages and technologies as possible: Python, Ruby, Kotlin, JavaScript, React, Java, C, DSA, SQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Wix, Velo, MERN, Next.js, C++, React Native and more. I sometimes laugh, wondering if I’d have been a straight-A student if I’d shown this much enthusiasm sudying my school sybjects. But deep down, I was only interested in computer science.",
    description3:
      "While in college, my friends and I even published a research paper on a smart irrigation IoT project. But let me be honest—midway through my BCA, I started regretting it. I had this whole, “Should I have just taken CSE in engineering?” moment. But by then, I was already too far down the road, so I stuck with it and kept pushing forward. This turned out to be one of the best decisions because I kept growing, learning, and developing my skills alongside some great friends.",
    description4:
      "Together, we started an IT club with the support of our professors to give tech exposure to our juniors. My friends have been a huge part of my journey, and having a solid team helped me become better in every way.",

      "After my first internship, the doors kept opening, and I went on to complete four internships in total. Then, with a shared vision, my friends and I took the plunge and started a freelancing company, Street2Site, aiming to help businesses transform their online presence. Working with clients has been rewarding and has taught me how to run a business, manage projects, and deliver quality results.",

      "Outside of work, I started going to the gym, determined to get in shape. Gym life has been its own journey, complete with injuries (yep, even a spinal injury) and some solid setbacks. Whenever I felt down, lifting weights became my go-to therapy. After all, sweat beats regret any day!",

      "My inspirations, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam and Tamil hip-hop artist Hiphop Tamizha, taught me the value of resilience and passion. Ennada periya K-pop, Hip-hop theriyuma! One of my dreams was to return to my college as a guest speaker, and recently, Kishan and I had the opportunity to visit Christ University as resource persons, which was a huge milestone for me.",
